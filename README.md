# Land coverage change since the rise of Wal-mart near its headquarters in northwest Arkansas in comparison to other urban areas in the state

Project by Jason Wilcox

**Summary**  
Wal-Mart first opened a headquarters and distribution center in Bentonville, AR in 1970. Many supplementary developments occurred and it was a catalyst for growth in the area. How has land cover changed since this occurred? How does it compare to other growth in the state, from the capital of Little Rock to other major cities like Fort Smith and Jonesboro?

**Problem statement/objective**  
The massive success of Wal-Mart has clear effects on the land cover and value of the area around its headquarters. What are some potential effects not considered in regards to the local area?

**Datasets**  
Here will be stuff from the NLCDB and some census data.

**Python packages**  
Pandas, Geopandas, Numpy, Map plot

**Methods/Approach**  
Compare the areas in northwest Arkansas to significant cities elsewhere in the state from 1970 and to current day. A midpoint approach might be best to include, so we will look at 1970, 1997, and 2024. Land coverage, land value, average income, population growth and education status will be good things to look at.

**Expected outcomes**  
There will be a higher amount of change from farmland and natural areas to developed areas in northwest Arkansas as compared to other areas in the state as well as a bigger change in land values and incomes.

**Other relevant**  
Further reaching effect outwards beyond the state, loss of small businesses, Walton wealth, state's focus on Wal-Mart.
